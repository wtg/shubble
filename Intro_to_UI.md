# Introduction to the UI: Beginner Friendly 

This section provides a simple overview of how to access and interact with the project’s user interface. It explains the basic layout, what each part of the UI is responsible for, and how developers can navigate it during testing. Even if you’re new to the project, this guide will help you understand the UI’s role in the overall system.

# UI Overview & Developer 

## Purpose of the UI

The purpose of the UI is to provide a clear, user-friendly way to interact with the project’s main features while also presenting them in a clean and visually appealing layout. It helps developers test functionality, understand how users will experience the system, and ensure that both the interface and the underlying logic work together smoothly.

## How to Access the UI
Verify that all [setup instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md) have been completed first.

To view the UI while you're developing, you’ll start the frontend's development server. Use the following steps below: 
#### 1. Run the command in your terminal:
  In the project’s root folder (the main `shubble` foler) run: 
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This command launches a development server so you can run and test your frontend application locally.

#### 2. Wait for the local address to appear:
  Once the dev server starts, your terminal will show a link where the UI is running. It usually looks like:  
  ```bash
  http://localhost:5173/
  ``` 
  The port your development server runs on may differ based on the project’s configuration and whichever ports are free on your system.

#### 3. Open the UI in your browser:

- **Mac:** `Command + Click` the link the terminal prints.
- **Windows:** `Ctrl + Click` the link the terminal prints.

This will open the UI in your browser automatically.

#### 4. To stop the UI:
Return to the terminal where npm run dev is running and press `Ctrl + C` to terminate the development server.
